Yeah, Aujla
Show <span>MXRCI</span>

We communicate <span>refraining</span> form 
unnecessary shout. 
They will never <span>succeed</span> in stopping me.
Day or night, i remain focused on myself 
and find <span>enjoyment.</span>
<span>I</span> pay no mind to the person at the <span>summit</span>,	
for I am a lion within myself
<span>T</span>here were days when 
our clothes were <span>torn</span> and 
patched up with <span>stiches</span>.
And now such days have arrived 	
when we wear <span>louis Vuitton</span> attire 
and remain <span>u</span>nfazed
We may have plenty of <span>money</span> but
we are cautious about spending it;
we also fret over it
<span>Girl</span> you have received wrong 
information about <span>us</span>,
we are not <span>worthless</span>, 
we are very hard working in reality.
I have never<span> boasted</span> about my awards , 
nor have i sought congratulations from anyone
Our <span>distractors</span> may have 
<span>g</span>limpsed our <span>guns</span> and cars , 
but have never flaunted to them.
Here our <span>guns</span>, there is also a torch and we,
also have a <span>horse</span> and
 <span>car</span> of <span>Porsche</span> company.
<span>D</span>espite owning many things, i never take the wheel;
its always my <span>friends</span> who drive  
<span>i</span>f the song ends , it doesn't mean life will end too
We don't just <span>look</span> good on <span>o</span>utside.
We don't do <span>drugs</span> like our haters.
Our <span>enemies</span> will never be able to stop us.
<span>the</span> things we have learned 
<span>or</span> gained through hard work
and <span>perseverance</span>, 
those are the lessons that can never be taught.
No one has witnessed the <span>struggles</span> i have endured,
yet when i wear <span>expensive</span> items,
people <span>accuse</span> me of showing off.
My heart has been broken many times but 
it has never <span>shattered</span> in pieces.
My <span>enemies</span> have tried to uproot my roots,
but they never <span>succeeded</span>,
<span>Girl</span> have received wrong information about us,
we are not <span>worthless </span>, 
we are very <span>hardworking</span> in reality,
When there is nothing else on one side   
<span>Hard work</span> is what counts the most
and those who considered 
themselves very <span>great</span> are equivalent to 
the tip of my <span>shoe</span>. 
people even don't allow to <span>showcase</span>
what i have <span>earned</span> from my hard work.
People don't even let me live <span>peacefully</span>, 
there is always <span>some</span> 
<span>obstacle</span> in every task i do. 
We <span>appreciate</span> new talent.
We never let anyone <span>down</span>, 
i do not target anyone from my <span>songs</span>,
<span>Success</span> keeps coming our way ; 
we never asked it from <span>God</span>
Who are my <span>haters</span> and want to stop me,
<span>W</span>ill never able to stop me, 
My haters always keeps <span>wondering</span>
how i have broken so many <span>records</span>   
<span>Those</span> who criticize me  are the ones 
who will eventually need <span>me</span> 
The <span>artists</span> in my industry
and my relative may <span>ponder</span>, but they 
never enquire about how <span>i</span>, 
<Span>once</Span> from broken home, 
attained such <span>successes</span>
I am on <span>top</span> and i have never come down .
My paperwork is not clean in the <span>police</span> 
station <span>case</span>.
<span>G</span>irl you have received wrong information about us,
we are not <span>worthless</span>, 
we are very <span>hardworking</span> in reality.
